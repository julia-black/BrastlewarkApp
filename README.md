# BrastlewarkApp
Simple Android app for finding inhabitants of the village Brastlewark.

## Technology
- MVVM: for interaction between logic and interface
- Clean Architecture: for decreasing coupling between classes and their dependencies
- Koin: for dependency injection
- RxJava: for reactive work with requests from API
- Glide: for showing and caching images
- Binding: for access to views
- Retrofit: for work with API
- JUnit: for testing.
 
P.S. I think the most important test is logic test, so I added tests for my use cases with logic in domain module.
